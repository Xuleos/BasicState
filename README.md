BasicState is a really, really simple key-value based state management solution. It makes use of [BindableEvents](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/BindableEvent) to allow your projects to watch for changes in state, and provides a simple API for communication with your state objects. Think [Rodux](https://roblox.github.io/rodux/), but much more simple.

## Getting Started
[Visit the documentation site][docs] to get started with BasicState, see examples, and view the full documentation.

## Contributors
A huge thanks to [the contributors][contribs] of this project. You've added some awesome new features and helps work out a few kinks.

## Documentation
Documentation is available on the [documentation site][docs].

## Examples
For examples, please see the [documentation site][docs-example].

**Basic example:**
```typescript
import BasicState from "@rbxts/BasicState";

interface IState {
    Hello: String
}

let State = new BasicState({
    Hello: "World"
} as IState);

State.GetChangedSignal("Hello").Connect((NewValue, OldValue) => {
    print(`Hello, {NewValue}; goodbye {OldValue}!`);
});

State.SetState({
    Hello: "Roblox"
} as IState)

//    Triggers the RBXScriptConnection above and prints
//    "Hello, Roblox; goodbye World!"

```

**Usage with Roact (EXAMPLE NOT IN TYPESCRIPT)**

`MyProject.Store.lua`:

```lua
local BasicState = require(path.to.BasicState)

local Store = BasicState.new({
    Hello = "World"
})

return Store
```

`MyProject.Components.MyComponent.lua`:
```lua
local Roact = require(path.to.Roact)
local MyComponent = Roact.Component:extend("MyComponent")

local Store = require(script.Parent.Parent.Store)

function MyComponent:render()
    return Roact.createElement("TextButton", {
        Text = string.format("Hello, %s!", self.state.Hello),
        --> Displays "Hello, World!"

        [Roact.Event.MouseButton1Click] = function()
            Store:SetState({ Hello = "Roblox" })
            --> Will re-render and display "Hello, Roblox!"
        end
    })
end

--[[
    Wrap the component with the BasicState store and inject
    the value of Hello into the component state.
--]]
return Store:Roact(MyComponent, { "Hello" })
```
